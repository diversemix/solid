# message-store

An example "Message Store" to demonstrate SOLID principles.

----

## Background

This repository are my own personal notes taken from doing the Pluralsight course on
[Encapsulation & SOLID](https://app.pluralsight.com/courses/55b3efd7-1363-46d7-8542-1c9a100502fe/table-of-contents).
As part of doing this course I have also converted the examples to Javascript
(Typescript) for my own sanity.

## Caveats

This repository has been build to make it easy to follow the lessons, its not
production code or environment.

## Lesson Zero

:children_crossing: Understand the example you will be using throughout these lessons.

- Take a look at the `src` folder, start by looking at the interface in `types.ts`
- See if you can guess the implementation just by looking at the interfaces.
- Look at the implementation in `message-store.ts`
- Looking at the sample in `index.ts` see if you can guess the output.
- Now run the example by executing `make run` from inside the `message-store` folder.

## Lesson One

:children_crossing: Understand how to make your code readable.

- Implementation hiding
- Commands and Queries
- Postel's Law
